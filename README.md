tips to working with git and github
Megan Carpenter
I'm a statistics major with a math minor.
I work at a bank as a teller. I recently bought a house so I love hanging out there, and I have been busy decorating it.
Three important strategies for me to orangize my work include; writing everything down, time managment, and having a tidy work space.

In the past month, I have been getting used to my new class schedule, doing all of my classwork, and attending all of my new classes.
For organizing my work I usually keep track of all of the due dates that I have for my work, I keep everything organized in folders, and I try and plan out when I will do all of my work so that it is done on time.
